## Direct Ptychography Transfer of Information

- Phase-compensated SSB &rarr; performed with (known) aberrations [@10.1038/ncomms12532]
- Segmented detectors very good at approximating SSB signal [@10.1016/j.ultramic.2014.09.013]
- Optimum BF STEM &rarr; very similar to SSB, better normalization kernel [@10.1016/j.ultramic.2020.113133]
