## Iterative Ptychography

- STEM inverse problem &rarr; model-based iterative algorithms [@10.1063/1.1823034]
  - Can solve for both the object and (often unknown) probe illumination
  - Flexible and easy to adapt for additional physics (multi-slice, mixed-state)
  - Relaxes stringent sampling constraints using defocused probe redundancy
- Diffraction intensities modeled, compared with experiments [@10.1016/j.ultramic.2009.05.012]
