## Electron Microscopy Phase Problem

- The "phase problem" &rarr; loss of phase information during intensity measurements
  - well-known challenge in many imaging and diffraction fields
- Phase _contrast_ imaging {cite:p}`10.1016/s0031-8914(42)80079-8` &rarr; convert phase variations into intensity variations
